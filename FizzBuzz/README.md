# :office_worker: FIZZ BUZZ

### üìù Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity. A typical round of Fizz Buzz can be: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‚Äò3‚Äô print ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù instead of the number and for the multiples of ‚Äò5‚Äô print ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù.
