# :rock: :scissors: :page_facing_up: Rock, paper, scissors

# 📝 Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 

# These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. 

 # 🔣 Use Ascii Art to represent each of the shapes assigned to variables, rock, paper, and scissors.
